## Submit app to AppSource
AppSource helps business users to find and try SaaS apps from Microsoft and its partners. Microsoft AppSource apps include Web Apps and apps built on Microsoft dynamics. Your app must be listed on AppSource and the Teams app store. You must successfully complete the approval process. This is provided by Microsoft Teams that verifies your app works as described and contains the relevant metadata and content that is valuable to the other.
The following documents take you through the submission checklist for submitting an app to AppSource:
* [Pre-submission checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist)
* [App manifest checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/app-manifest-checklist)
* See [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) and follow the app manifest schema to include the information about your purchasable web app on Teams.

## Publish purchasable web apps

Publish your web apps on the app store for users to purchase them directly from the Teams client experience. These apps have all the capabilities provided by the Teams platform, like web apps that are available on AppSource.
Get started with the publishing process for web apps on Teams, follow the steps mentioned in [submitting your app on Partner Center](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/publish).
See the documentation on [how to create a SaaS offer in the commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/create-new-saas-offer).

## Software as a Service (SaaS) on Teams app store

Teams apps are free to install, however, some apps require purchasing service subscriptions to experience the application's full functionality and scope. These service subscriptions are called SaaS offers, which are available for purchase through AppSource and now through the Microsoft Teams app store.
After your offer has been submitted to Partner Center along with the appropriate plans for the offer, a review is conducted. After it passes the validation, it is available for you to test and publish it to our commercial marketplace. In the commercial marketplace, your offer is automatically available for purchase from the Teams app store along with AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

## End-user purchase experience

* After users navigate to an app that supports purchases, they are provided with an option to view subscription plans supported by the offer.
